## Wireframes ##

Basic wireframes were created using:  [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/?gclid=CjwKCAiAioifBhAXEiwApzCztmrYyxAPBxLRN4Bwln_l2_qnf61z9Q9qNSW19hUH5Altv9asetRaQBoChAgQAvD_BwE "Balsamiq"). 

During the deployment proccess i changed a few elements.

Markup : <details>
           <summary>Wireframe for desktop and tablets</summary>
           ![desktop wireframe](assets/images/desktopwf.png)
         </details>

## Design and techniques ##

* When i started the project i made some wireframes by drawing and implemented on Balsamic (Does not look so good, i need to improve or next time might use photoshop instead.)
* After i designed the page using HTML and CSS on Gitpod. For hosting the page i use Github.

## Testing and bugs ##

### Unfixed Bugs ###

* Images in the gallery load a bit slowly. The problem could be solved by reducing teh files with squoosh but as it is just a learning project i think it would take too many time to upload and reduce and replace them in github as well one by one.

### Responsiveness ##

* All pages have been tested for screens from 240px and up.
* I used Chrome Developer Tool for testing and i tested all the pages with all the avialable phone simulations both in verical and horizontal mode.
* The site is responsive on any screensizes and the images are not pixelled or stretched.
